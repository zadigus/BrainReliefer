    <title>System Icon Tray</title>
    <description>It would be handy to have the brain booster application running in background. To do so, I can call 
	QApplication::setQuitOnLastWindowClosed(false); 
in the code and have a look at the example given by Qt's System Icon Tray example.

    <title>Implement the "One day maybe" incubation list</title>
    <description>In addition to the incubated intrants we want to be notified about at some date in the future, we need a list for incubated intrants that have no deadline. For example, intrants of the type "Learn Spanish", "Learn how to cook", "Go to Australia", etc., may belong to this list.</description>

    <description>I have already connected the DataManager to the ReferencesModel::reload. I only need to implement the loading of the XML from the DataManager and the emission of the referencesLoaded signal.</description>
